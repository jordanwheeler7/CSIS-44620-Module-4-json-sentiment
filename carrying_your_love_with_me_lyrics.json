"10 ContributorsCarrying Your Love with Me Lyrics[Verse 1]\nBaby all I got is this beat up leather bag\nAnd everything I own don't fill up half\nBut don't you worry about the way I pack\nAll I care about is getting back real soon\nA goodbye kiss is all I need from you\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm carrying your love with me\nWest Virginia down to Tennessee\nI'll be moving with the good Lord's speed\nCarrying your love with me\nIt's my strength for holding on\nEvery minute that I have to be gone\nI'll have everything I ever need\nCarrying your love with me\n\n[Verse 2]\nOn a lonely highway, stuck out in the rain\nDarling all I have to do is speak your name\nThe clouds roll back and the waters part\nThe sun starts shining in my heart for you\nYou're right there in everything I do\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm carrying your love with me\nWest Virginia down to Tennessee\nI'll be moving with the good Lord's speed\nCarrying your love with me\nIt's my strength for holding on\nEvery minute that I have to be gone\nI'll have everything I'll ever need\nI'm carrying your love with me\nSee George Strait LiveGet tickets as low as $105You might also like[Outro]\nI'm carrying your love with me\nWest Virginia down to Tennessee\nI'll be moving with the good Lord's speed\nCarrying your love with me1Embed"
