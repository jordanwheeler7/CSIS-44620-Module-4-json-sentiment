Use this function to print the polarity scores (with the name of the song) of the three files you created in question 3.  Does the reported polarity match your understanding of the song's lyrics? Why or why not do you think that might be?  Answer the questions in either a comment in the code cell or a markdown cell under the code cell."

    "#### I am kind of surprised by the results of the sentiment analysis.  Blank Space would have a slightly higher neagtive sentiment in my opinion.  However, I can see it being a more neutral song as well so the slight negative sentiment fits. How to talk to girls is definitley a more positive song. While the lyrics do not read that way, it is talking about how hard it is to speak to his wife and daughter because of how much they mean to him.  Still goin down is another one that I felt should be a positive.  I do not really agree that it even has a slightly negative sentiment so it surprises me that it was almost neutral.  Finally, Carrying Your Love With Me is aa love song.  It talks about how even though he may be gone, all he needs is the love of his signiificant other and everything is ok.  This song is a very positive song so I am a little shocked that it does not have a higher sentiment.  From how I take the lyrics, they are all positive."
