The following code accesses the [lyrics.ovh](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/lyrics-of-a-song/search) public api, searches for the lyrics of a song, and stores it in a dictionary object.  Write the resulting json to a file (either a JSON file or a pickle file; you choose). You will read in the contents of this file for future questions so we do not need to frequently access the API."

    "#### I am kind of surprised by the results of the sentiment analysis. Blank Space would have a slightly higher neagtive sentiment in my opinion. However, I can see it being a more neutral song as well so the slight negative sentiment fits. How to talk to girls is definitley a more positive song. While the lyrics do not read that way, it is talking about how hard it is to speak to his wife and daughter because of how much they mean to him. Still goin down is another one that I felt should be a positive. I do not really agree that it even has a slightly negative sentiment so it surprises me that it was almost neutral. Finally, Carrying in Your Love With Me is aa love song. It talks about how even though he may be gone, all he needs is the love of his signiificant other and everything is ok. I think that because it talks about negative scenarios, the score got pushed to negative but, I believe it is a positive song."
